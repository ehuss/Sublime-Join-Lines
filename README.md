Sublime Join Lines
==================
This plugin provides an alternate behavior for Sublime's "Join Lines" command.  It gives you the ability to specify the text to insert between lines instead of always using a space.

Usage
-----
Select the lines you want to join and press the keyboard shortcut to bring up an input panel to specify which characters to use.

- Windows: Ctrl-Alt-J
- Linux: TODO
- OS X: TODO
